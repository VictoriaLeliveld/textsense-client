TextSense is a web application designed to help web developers analyze the readability and accessibility of their content. Users can paste in text, and the app provides suggestions to improve clarity, reduce complexity, and address common accessibility issues.

## How It Works
TextSense sends text input to a backend server powered by Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash AI, which analyzes the content and returns short, actionable suggestions to improve readability, clarity, and accessibility.
